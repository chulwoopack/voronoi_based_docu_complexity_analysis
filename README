This repo contains Efficient Voronoi-based Document Layout Complexity Analysis code (originally worked by K. Kise and modified by Faisal Shafait). 

1. How to Install

The code has two build files:
  - Makefile builds the code with the same input/output as that of
    original Kise's code  
  - Jamfile builds the code with the color-coded input/output
    conforming to the ISegmentPage interface in OCRopus

2. How to Use
   (1)

   (1) ./be -ddetail [path-to-file] ./data/linesegments/[linesegment-file-name] ./data/ccs/[cc-file-name]
   (2)
